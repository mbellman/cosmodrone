# cosmodrone
A game about space station maintenance!

### TODO:

##### GAME
* Drone: split energy into power/fuel, health into material/hardware
* Handler for drone running out of power
* Hardware terminals for station modules
* Hardware/part maintenance interface
* Ability to move drone "down" a layer, underneath the station
* Collisions/drone damage
* Loading bar/indicator of some kind
* Scene zoom-out when speeding up (?)
* Replace jQuery with vanilla JS (?)

##### BACKGROUND
* Rivers
* Brighten shadows

##### CODE STYLING
* Handy routine for checking on-screen condition
* See which classes can instead use prototypes
* Base "Component" class inherited by all components
* Why don't public functions have descriptions?
* Continue skimming through and clarifying variable names/comments
