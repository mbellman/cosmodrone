# cosmodrone
A game about space station maintenance...

### TODO:

##### GAME
* Have camera "chase" drone with a slight delay
* Scene zoom-out when speeding up (?)
* Drone rotation + movement in pointed direction
* Framerate still needs managing
* UI
* jQuery probably isn't necessary

##### BACKGROUND
* Rivers
* More cirrus clouds
* Brighten shadows

##### CODE STYLING
* Why don't public functions have descriptions?
