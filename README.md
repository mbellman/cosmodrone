# cosmodrone
A hush-hush game project.

### TODO:

##### GAME
* Background/cloud rendering is definitely going to need some optimizing
* Proper Sprite follow()/camera offset implementation
* Drone rotation + movement in pointed direction
* UI

##### BACKGROUND
* Rivers
* More cirrus clouds
* Brighten shadows

##### CODE STYLING
* Why don't public functions have descriptions?
