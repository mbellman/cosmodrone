# cosmodrone
A game about space station maintenance...

### TODO:

##### GAME
* Scene zoom-out when speeding up (?)
* Loading bar/indicator of some kind
* UI
* jQuery probably isn't necessary

##### BACKGROUND
* Rivers
* More cirrus clouds
* Brighten shadows

##### CODE STYLING
* "Queue" component of some kind to hold onto additional cyclical functions
* Handy routine for checking on-screen condition
* See which classes can instead use prototypes
* Why don't public functions have descriptions?
