# cosmodrone
A game about space station maintenance!

### TODO:

##### GAME
* Make GameInstance a component
* Title/menus
* Loading bar/indicator of some kind
* New drone sprite
* "Autospin" system indicator
* Radio signal reception mechanic
* Make sure hardware asset "light source" is adjusted based on the side of the module
* Collisions/drone damage
* Hardware/part maintenance interface
* Components with update cycles/architecture for various hardware parts
* Alerts screen with ability to select hardware maintenance jobs
* Handler for drone running out of power/fuel
* Ability to move drone above or below the station
* Text boxes/string printing
* Moving docking targets (later-stage development) (?)
* Scene zoom-out when speeding up (?)
* Replace jQuery with vanilla JS (?)

##### BACKGROUND
* Rivers
* Brighten shadows

##### CODE
* Handy routine for checking on-screen condition
* See which classes can instead use prototypes
* Base "Component" class inherited by all components
* Why don't public functions have descriptions?
* Continue skimming through and clarifying variable names/comments
