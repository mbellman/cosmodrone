# cosmodrone
A hush-hush game project.

### TODO:

##### BACKGROUND
* Dynamic cloud spawning and repopulation
* Make sure clouds properly scale with tile size
* Cloud shadows should be displaced with respect to the lighting angle
* Create more cloud assets
* Make sure code style is consistent across all files
* (?) Have cloud shadows displace in the direction of the screen center for a mild 3D effect
* (?) Add erosion to the heightmap generator

##### GAME
* UI
* Entire rest of game
